    <p>We’re an environmental charity with a difference. Our purpose is to inspire ways of living that are good for the environment. We do this by designing campaigns that make environmental actions desirable. We disrupt the status quo to raise awareness, nudge behaviours and shape systems. We do this with knowledge and playfulness, and we won’t make you feel bad. Design By Nature, brought to you by Hubbub, is an initiative that challenges students to find new ways to tackle environmental issues affecting our day-to-day lives. We celebrate innovation, creativity, disruptive thinking, collaboration and insight-led ideas that make sustainable living second nature.  – Hubbub from their own website.
      The website is focused on using nature for good and how we can rethink what we use and why we use it. From misshapen bread to using different containers to buy essentials like food in tubs instead of plastic bags and soap in your own bottles. </p>
